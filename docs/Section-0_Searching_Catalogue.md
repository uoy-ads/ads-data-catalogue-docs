# Searching the Catalogue

Navigating to the Data Catalogue reveals the results page and a series of filters along the left hand side. The catalogue initially displays all available results, which you can then filter using three key search parameters: What, Where, and When.

Each of the records shown in the search results has a **Resource Type** icon next to its title. These categories different resources into general areas of interest to archaeologists. Hovering your mouse over the icon will display the name of the Resource Type. If a resource contains more than one Resource type, then the icon will be displayed for first Resource type listed in the metadata (regardless of the one selected with the Resource Type filter). 

Resources that are to be found in a [**CoreTrustSeal certified repository**](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) will have an additional icon displayed below the Resource Type icon.

## Options for displaying the results
At the top right hand side of the Results page, there are two options for controlling the display of the results - **Order** and **Per page**.

| Order |  |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| ![List of options which determine the display order](../assets/31-Order_options.png) | **Relevance** - calculated from several fields (see below).<Br><Br>**Issued date** - date of publication of the resource (Default setting).<Br><Br>**Dating** - dating of resource record.<Br><Br>**Publisher** - data provider (of the resource metadata).<Br><Br>**Resource type** - broad resource type (as defined in Search Filters).|

| Per page |  |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| ![Drop down menu of values for how many results are displayed on the page](../assets/30-Per_page.png) | The number of resources shown on the Results page (default number is 20). <br><Br>The **Per page** option enables you to choose how many results are displayed per page, from 5 to 50. |

### How ‘Relevance’ is calculated

**Relevance** is basically a score allocated to resources that match the current search criteria based on the metadata for each entry into the catalogue. This score determines the order in which the resources are listed. The algorithm used gives the highest score to matches to the Title, followed by the Description and then the Subject fields. Following those fields, other fields such as location and time are also used to add to the relevance score. 

## Refining the search results
The search results can refined using a combination of **What, Where** and **When** as well as the individual filters. The following sections explain how each of these can be used to narrow down the search results.
