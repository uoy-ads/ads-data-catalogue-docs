Enter one or more keywords in the text search box. If you use multiple words, the search will only find results that include every word you've typed. This is referred to as "AND" logic in search terminology. For example, a search for “gold coin” will return only records where both these words, either adjacent or separately, are to be found in the metadata record. 

When a search term is entered, a list of up to 10 records is displayed where the term is found in one or more of the metadata fields. Records with matches in the highest number of fields are shown first.

## Fields

For the **Time Period, Place** and **Title** filters, only exact matches in the language used are returned. E.g. if **Time Period** is selected, the term Bronze Age, will return all records with the text “Bronze Age” in the Dating field.

The **Getty AAT Subject** option enables a multilingual search to be performed by returning all records that contain a native language match. Furthermore, since the search is hierarchical, any broad term such as “weapons” will also include all sub-categories such as swords, axes, daggers, etc. The search will return records that contain these subjects as well as those with matching terms in other languages.
