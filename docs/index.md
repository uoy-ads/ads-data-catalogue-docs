# Getting Started

The Archaeology Data Service [**Data Catalogue**](LINK) is a comprehensive platform for discovering and accessing archaeological data and resources from across the UK. 

With access to over 1 million archaeological resources, the catalogue solves the challenge of discovering relevant materials by bringing together collections deposited with the ADS into one searchable platform. Explore the UK's archaeological heritage through an intuitive interface that lets you search by location, time period, and subject matter.

The Catalogue allows you to search using multiple parameters:

- :classical_building: What (keywords and data types)
- :earth_americas: Where (geographic location)
- :clock1: When (time periods). 

Search results can also be displayed in multiple ways: as individual listings, aggregated on an interactive map, or plotted on a timeline view.

Built on the same robust infrastructure developed by the [ARIADNE Research Infrastructure](https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu/) for the [ARIADNE Portal](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/), our catalogue is specifically designed to serve the needs of the ADS community, while presenting our distinctive collection of archaeological datasets and digital resources.
