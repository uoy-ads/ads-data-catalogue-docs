# Welcome to the ADS Data Catalogue

The Archaeology Data Service [Data Catalogue](LINK) is a comprehensive platform for discovering and accessing archaeological data and resources from across the UK. Built on the same robust infrastructure developed by the [ARIADNE Research Infrastructure](https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu/) for the [ARIADNE Portal](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/), our catalogue is specifically designed to serve the needs of the ADS community while presenting our distinctive collection of archaeological datasets and digital resources.

The ADS Data Catalogue provides access to over 1 million archaeological resources that can be searched and filtered according to a number of criteria. The Catalogue allows you to search using multiple parameters - What (keywords and data types), Where (geographic location), and When (time periods). Search results can be displayed in multiple ways: as individual listings, aggregated on the interactive map, and plotted on the timeline view.

This user guide will help you navigate the features of the catalogue, from basic searching and browsing to advanced data discovery.
