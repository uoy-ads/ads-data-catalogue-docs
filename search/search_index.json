In many cases, it is also possible to map the subject matter to the Getty AAT but as this was developed as a more general thesaurus, it doesn\u2019t always contain the level of detail used in archaeology. To mitigate this, the original subject is also included in the search on all fields in the Catalogue and when the Getty AAT filter is used, the results are hierarchical i.e. they match the specified term(s) and all sub-terms. Consequently, it may be better to start with general terms and then narrow these down rather than starting with a very specific search term. </p>"},{"location":"Section-6_Tips_and_guidance/#strategies-for-working-with-varying-source-metadata","title":"Strategies for working with varying source metadata","text":"<p>The other major consideration is the supplied metadata which may vary from publisher to publisher depending on how their original source data is structured, the meaning attributed to the terminology used, how much metadata is available for mapping to the AO-CAT data model (and the extent to which the metadata can be cleaned and enhanced), etc. To give some examples of how this can affect the data in the Catalogue (and ways of mitigating the differences):</p> <ol> <li> <p>A text search will result in the most resources since a match may be found in one of several metadata fields. These may not all be relevant since a description can include the search term as a feature found on an object or on a site. Filters such as the Resource type and Getty AAT Subjects should be used for more targeted searches.</p> </li> <li> <p>The British Museum has supplied over 900,000 resources from the Portable Antiquities Scheme Database of which around half relate to coins and the other half to other types of artefacts which commonly make up \u2018finds\u2019. The coins all have Resource type \u201cCoin\u201d and the artefacts \u201cArtefacts\u201d. On the other hand, the DIME database (published by Aarhus University), which also records finds by the public in Denmark, has allocated Resource type \u201cArtefacts\u201d to all its resources, including coins. This is not wrong, it\u2019s just another way of representing the data. To select all the resources from DIME that are coins, it is necessary to use \u201ccoins\u201d as an initial search term and then filter by Publisher, Aarhus University, as the original subject (usually dime.find.coin) will indicate the type of artefact. The Getty AAT Subject has also been used, some granularity has been applied so five terms are listed of which the most common is \u201cLater western world coins\u201d (a sub-term of Coins (money)). </p> </li> <li> <p>Be aware that not all the resources (approx. 8%) have geographical co-ordinates supplied in their metadata and, where the location of the resource is considered sensitive, a bounding box will be shown containing a random \u2018pin\u2019 to indicate the approximate area. If there is a nearby resource, one pin will be shown \u2013 this can be clicked on to show the corresponding record. Where there are more than one resources nearby, these are shown in series, i.e. one at a time with each successive resource in the same location. This also means that in most cases, when the map filter is applied, the number of resources found will automatically reduce as all those missing location co-ordinates will be excluded from the results. </p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is possible to search the Catalogue using the (modern-day) Country filter, this can be fairly meaningless in the context of archaeology (even more so for marine archaeology!). Recorded place names are included in the metadata. More usefully, the Map allows the selection of areas of interest, including defining an area by drawing a polygon thus enabling borders to be ignored or otherwise. However, it can be useful to define a country, particularly islands or where national boundaries have remained fairly unchanged. One way to do this is through the Publisher filter as many of these providers are the national repository for their archaeological outputs. In many cases, Publishers have provided a Collection record which summarises provided datasets. Alternatively, the When filter can also include regions (within the PeriodO definitions) which may be used for defining areas of interest. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Section-6_Tips_and_guidance/#working-with-time-periods","title":"Working with time periods","text":"<p>Two approaches have been used to denote time periods \u2013 absolute start and end dates and period names. There are some obvious issues with both methods: - If absolute dates are used across more than one country, it is likely that resources will be found that are not of interest as the dates can overlap from other periods or they may be approximate. - PeriodO terms are used to describe archaeological time periods; it is well known that a defined period (e.g. \u201cBronze age\u201d) in one country may cover a different time span in another country. However, the filter has been designed so that one or more defined periods may be used with the further option of restricting the named period(s) to a specific region(s). </p>"},{"location":"Section-6_Tips_and_guidance/#some-examples-of-using-the-catalogue-to-answer-research-questions","title":"Some examples of using the Catalogue to answer research questions","text":""},{"location":"Section-6_Tips_and_guidance/#video-doing-a-search","title":"Video: doing a search","text":"<p>Video demonstration of a search.
